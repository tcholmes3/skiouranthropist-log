Now that we've got the data, we need a way to access it

What we really need is a list of all the events,
that way we have variables to enter into our calculations later.

So let's go ahead and write a function that does just that.
To do so we need to create a function that dives down into
The array assigned to JOURNAL
The objects inside that array
The key of 'events' inside each object and
The value paired to 'events'
Which is an array containing the values we need

                events.push(event);

]
*/

/* Alright, so we have the list. Now what? Well, the data still
 isn't organized in a way that's helpful. Remember, the 
 objective is to determine the correlation between specific events
 and whether or not our subject transformed into a mouse.
 How might we do that? Let's think: there have to be four variables.

 Using 'peanuts' as an example:
 1) The subject did not eat peanuts and did not turn into a squirrel that night. Let's call this (false, false) 
 2) The subject ate peanuts and did not turn into a squirrel that night. Let's call this (true, false)
 3) The subject did not eat peanuts and turned into a squirrel that night
 Let's call this (false, true)
 4) The subject ate peanuts and turned into a squirrel that night 
 Let's call this (true, true)

 Since we're going to be counting the number of occurences for each of these variable,
 they'll be represented numerically. What's good for ordering numeric values?
 Arrays! You bet! In order to be non-arbitrary, we'll transcribe the index value of the array in binary thus:

(true, true) => 11 = 3;
(true, false) => 10 = 2;
(false, true) => 01 =  1;
(false, false) => 00 = 0;

Now we're getting somewhere! 
Let's create a function that extracts a specific event from the journal
and creates an array based on the index-values above.
Okay, one step at a time*/

//1) create a function that takes an EVENT and the journal as parameters
function arrayFor(event, journal) {
    //2) stages an array
    let array = [0, 0, 0, 0];
    // 3) loops over every entry i.e. OBJECT in the journal
    for (let i = 0; i < journal.length; i++) {
        // 4) Defines what an entry is and
        // 5) Assigns each entry object an appropriate index while

        let entry = journal[i],
            index = 0; //default(false, false)

        // 6) Evaluating if the entry object contains the event as a value under the key events using methods includes()
        if (entry.events.includes(event)) index += 1; //(false, true)

        // 7)Evaluating if the entry key squirrel is true
        if (entry.squirrel) index += 2; //if prev true (true, true) i.e. 3 : (true, false) i.e. 2

        // 8)And moving on to the next entry object
        array[index] += 1;
    }
    // 9)Before returning the completed array
    return array;
}

console.log(arrayFor("peanuts", JOURNAL)); //[77, 8, 0, 5]

/*
HOT PEANUTS!

(true, false) => 2 = 0;
(false, true) => 1 =  8;
(false, false) => 0 = 77;

*/

/*Task #3: Calculating Correlation

So now we've got a list of events to draw from,
and a way to meaningfully represent the data numerically.
We're set to begin calculations. Mind you, I'm no statistician, but I do know a few things. 
First, correlation is a measure of dependence between statistical variables.
Secondly, correlation between variables is usually expressed as a value that ranges from -1 to 1. 
Zero correlation means the variables are not related. 
A correlation of one indicates that the two are perfectly related. 
Negative one also means that the variables are perfectly related but that they are oppositesâ€”when one is true, the other is false.
Finally, to calculate the measure of correlation between two variables, we can use the phi coefficient (Ï•).

phi coefficient = ((true, true) * (false, false)) - ((true, false) * (false, true))/
sqrt of((true, -) * (false, -) * (-, true) * (-, false))

For the event 'peanuts', the calculation would be this:

phi coefficient = ((5) * (77)) - ((0) * (8))/
sqrt of((5) * (85) * (13) * (77))

So what we need now is to translate this calculation into a function.
This should be relatively straightforward as long as we keep our
array index-values and what they represent in terms of true/false in mind
*/

function phi(arr) {
    return (
        (arr[3] * arr[0] - arr[2] * arr[1]) /
        Math.sqrt(
            (arr[3] + arr[2]) *
            (arr[1] + arr[0]) *
            (arr[3] + arr[1]) *
            (arr[2] + arr[0])
        )
    );
}

/*Task #4: Application

Now we just need to plug the 'peanut' array into the function and
viola!
*/

phi([77, 8, 0, 5]); //0.59026798116852

/*
But hold on! We're not done yet! What about all those other events?
They're important too! We've got to get to the bottom of the subject's
bizarre transformations. Looks like it's time for another function.
This one needs to:
1) Loop over every event item in the events array
2) Return it to a function that constructs a numerical array
3) And return that array to a function that calculates the phi coefficient 

Fortunately for us, JavaScript is pretty flexible about where we
input our functions. For example, we can use them as variables
in loops and even pass them as parameters in other functions.
So let's take full advantage of this functionality
